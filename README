GC-NetPad
==================================

GC-NetPad is a thing I hacked up after playing with Dolphin on my computer.
Using the keyboard to control is doable, certainly. But I want to use my
GameCube controller, and I don't feel like spending money on an adaptor for
my computer that I probably won't use very much.

Solution:
Write a server for the Wii that pushes controller data out to a client, then
have the client emulate a joystick for the computer.


This program is written only for Linux users, and not planned to be extended to other
platforms.


Compiling
----------------

Enter client/, type 'make' to compile.

Building the server assumes that you have a way to run the generated files, and that
you already have devkitPro and libogc available.

Enter server/
export DEVKITPPC=/path/to/devkitppc
export DEVKITPRO=/path/containing-libogc/
Type 'make' to compile.
If you have wiiload in your environment, type 'make run' to wiiload the executable.


Running
----------------

Run the generated DOL or ELF file on your Wii.
On the computer, become root:
user$ sudo -s
[sudo] password for user:
user#

Export the WII environment variable that points to the Wii's IP address (use 'nslookup wii'
if you don't know)
user# export WII="192.168.1.5"

Run the client:
user# ./client

There will now be a new input device available in programs such as Dolphin.


Todo
----------------

Support for multiple GC pads, possibly Wiimotes as well?
Provide precompiled Wii homebrew package
